This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the Introducton to R and R Studio 50 minute session. Slides and othr course materials are located [on github](z.umn.edu/rtutorial). 

RNotebook is a format that lets you run code and display the results in a format that can be interactively run and shared as an html file. 

For example the following displays a simple scatterplot for the data in the built-in dataset "cars". 

We will be using RNotebook to display code and examples. All the commands seen in these snippits can be run in the CONSOLE or in a .R file

```{r}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

# Set up a new project in R
Using "File --> New Project" set up a new project in a new directory. This is where we will save our files and work. 

# Set your working directory to the directory you just created. 

This can be done with the following code, or by using the toolbar with "Session --> Set Working Directory"

```{r}
setwd("~/projects/TeachingRIntro50Minutes")
```


# Install any libraries you will need

This only needs to be done once for each package

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```



# Load Libraries into memory. 
This needs to be done each time you load R/RStudio

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Load some data into R
In this case, we are just assigning some data, both numbers and text, of various types. R has a lot of different data structures and types that you will learn as you explore R and as you need to do different things with R.

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- "Rstats"
z <- c("rstats", "perl", "bash", "python")
```


# Built-in dataset that comes with R 
R comes with a number or built-in datasets that you can explore.  


```{r}
mtcars
cardata <- mtcars
cardata
```

# Loading our own dataset (from .csv files) into R
the read.csv function will load a csv file into RStudio. It has a number of options. 

```{r}
data <- read.csv("mpls_energy_benchmarking_2015.csv", header=TRUE, na.strings=c("N/A", "Not Available", "NA", "0"))
```

# Get to know your data
Lets do some basic exploration of our data

```{r}
names(data)
str(data)
nrow(data)
ncol(data)
head(data)
tail(data)
```

# Getting help inside R

```{r}
?names
?read.csv
```


# Basic summary statistics

```{r}
summary(data$energy_star_score)
```


# Plot our data
We can use the built in plotting libraries that comes with base R to plot our data in various ways. 

```{r}
plot(data$water_use)
boxplot(data$energy_star_score)
boxplot(data$energy_star_score ~ data$org_name)
hist(data$energy_star_score)
```

# Export a dataset to a CSV file

```{r}
write.csv(data, "data.csv")
```
