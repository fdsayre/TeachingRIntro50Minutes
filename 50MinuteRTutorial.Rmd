This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the Introducton to R and R Studio 50 minute session. Slides and othr course materials are located [here](z.umn.edu/rtutorial). 

RNotebook is a format that lets you run code and display the results in a format that can be shared as an html file. For example the following displays a simple scatterplot for the data in the built-in dataset "cars". We will be using RNotebook to display code and examples. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

# Set your working directory
# This can be done with the following code, or by using the toolbar with "Session --> Set Working Directory"

```{r}
setwd("~/projects/TeachingRIntro50Minutes")
```


# Install any libraries you will need
# This only needs to be done once for each package

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


# Load Libraries into memory. This needs to be done each time you load R/RStudio

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Load some data into R

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- "Rstats"
z <- c("rstats", "perl", "bash", "python")
```

# ACTIVITY: Load some data into R


# Loading a built-in dataset that comes with R 

```{r}
cardata <- cars
```

# Loading our own dataset (.csv files) into R

```{r}
cardata2 <- read.csv("cardata.csv", header = TRUE)


data <- read.csv("mpls_energy_benchmarking_2015.csv", header=TRUE, na.strings=c("N/A", "Not Available", "NA", "0"))
```

# Get to know your data
# Lets do some basic exploration of our data

```{r}
names(data)
str(data)
nrow(data)
ncol(data)
head(data)
tail(data)
```


# Basic summary statistics

```{r}
summary(data$energy_star_score)
```


# Plot our data

```{r}

```


# Export a dataset to a CSV file

```{r}
write.csv(cardata, "cardata.csv")
```
