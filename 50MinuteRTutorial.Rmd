This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook for the Introducton to R and R Studio 50 minute session. Slides and othr course materials are located [here](z.umn.edu/rtutorial). 

RNotebook is a format that lets you run code and display the results in a format that can be shared as an html file. For example the following displays a simple scatterplot for the data in the built-in dataset "cars". We will be using RNotebook to display code and examples. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

# Set working directory
# This can also be done using Session --> Set Working Directory
```{r}
setwd("~/projects/TeachingRIntro50Minutes")
```


# Install any libraries you will need
# This only needs to be done once

```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```


# Load Libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```


# Load some data into R

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- "Rstats"
z <- c("rstats", "perl", "bash", "python")
```

# ACTIVITY: Load some data into R


# Loading a built-in dataset that comes with R 

```{r}
cardata <- cars
```

# Loading our own dataset (.csv files) into R


# Get to know your data

# Basic summary statistics

# Plot our data


# Export a dataset to a CSV file
